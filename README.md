# Gun-Deaths-in-US-2006-2020

- Gun Deaths are horrible and tragic, they lead to heated discussions about public safety, individual rights, and societal well-being.

- My goal here is to highlight the major factors that cause high and increasing numbers of gun deaths and to help making decisions to decrease these numbers.

- I created a dashboard that provides statistical analysis about the increase of number of deaths per year, the intent of the deaths, the place of deaths and the races.


## Insights from the Dashboard
- Suicide is the main intent of gun deaths
- The number of gun deaths is increasing every year with a significant increase in 2020.
- The gun deaths usually happen at home, which is 55% more than the other places combined.
- The white race is significantly the highest race involved in gun deaths.
- The number of males victims in gun deaths is significantly higher than the number of females victims.
